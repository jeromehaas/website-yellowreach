Each time the pages of Yellowreach are accessed, usage data is transmitted by the respective Internet browser and stored in log files, the so-called server log files.

We evaluate these log file data records in order to further improve our offer on the Yellowreach website and to make it more user-friendly, to find and correct errors more quickly and to control server capacities. At the same time, we use the log file data records to defend against attacks on our Yellowreach website, e.g. in the context of so-called distributed denial of service attacks, which aim to block access to our Yellowreach website by overloading it with requests. Exactly which data is collected is listed in the sections on the individual analysis tools.</P>
